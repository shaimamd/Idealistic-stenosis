1.Select only the walls of the main mesh
2. Unwrapping can be done in two ways either using the calculator or programmable filter in paraview.
3. Using calculator:
4. Select Coordinate results and type the following code in the calculator entry space
Note:The cylinder looks circle in X-Y coordinates and is extruded along the z axis.
0*iHat+(atan(coordsY/coordsX)+(coordsX/abs(coordsX))*1.570796326)*(coordsX^2+coordsY^2)^(1/2)*jHat+coordsZ*kHat
The mapping to a plane is done as follows:
X= axis is zero , based on the number specified the plane gets translated
Y= the points are mapped to the plane ,
 first term represents finding the arclength using tan relation(s=R* \theta)
 second part represents a way to solve the inconsistency that occurs when Y=90 degrees.
 The same point has to be mapped to either -pi/2 or pi/2
 if xaxis is +ve add pi/2 , if negative add -pi/2
 Z=same as old.
